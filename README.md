# **Analysis of Factors Influencing HDB Flat Resale Prices in Singapore**

## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the factors influencing the resale prices of HDB flats in Singapore. The analysis explores various aspects such as floor area, lease duration, flat models, and location, aiming to uncover key trends and insights valuable for stakeholders in the real estate market, urban planning, and housing policy.

## Objectives
- To identify key factors that influence the resale prices of HDB flats in Singapore.
- To analyze the impact of variables such as floor area, lease duration, flat models, and location on pricing.
- To provide actionable insights for real estate professionals, policymakers, and potential buyers/sellers.

## Data
The dataset includes various attributes related to HDB flats, such as:
- Transaction Date
- Town
- Flat Type
- Storey Range
- Floor Area (sqm)
- Flat Model
- Lease Commencement Date
- Resale Price
- Remaining Lease
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Real Price (adjusted for CPI)
- Block Number

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
   - Handled missing values, standardized formats, and derived new features.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted descriptive statistics and visualized relationships between variables using scatter plots, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
   
3. **Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations to compare trends across different years and identify patterns.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Identified significant correlations between variables to understand their impact on resale prices.

## Key Findings
- **Floor Area**: Larger floor areas are associated with higher resale prices.
- **Lease Duration**: Longer remaining leases generally lead to higher prices.
- **Flat Models**: Premium and executive flat models command higher resale values.
- **Location**: Certain towns or regions exhibit higher resale prices, reflecting their desirability.
- **Year:** Noticeable growing trends in resale prices in the most recent decade.

## Limitations
- The analysis is limited to available variables and does not account for other factors such as neighborhood amenities or broader economic conditions.
- Correlation analysis does not imply causation, and further modeling is needed to establish causal relationships.

## Future Work
- **Incorporate Additional Variables**: Include more granular data on amenities, neighborhood characteristics, and socio-economic factors.
- **Advanced Modeling**: Apply regression models or machine learning techniques to predict resale prices and identify causative factors.
